If productive chains are strengthened to generate more decent work opportunities, income  \\nand better access to basic goods and services, the population will benefit  from socially \\ninclusive and environmentally sustainable economic development , because shared prosperity \\nwould be generated from a productive development strategy that promotes scientific and \\ntechnological innovation, entrepreneurship, productivity and com petitiveness.  \\n15. As a result, e conomic development with a sustainable approach could serve as a basis for \\npromoting integrated territorial development at the local level, without environmental \\ndegradation of marine and terrestrial ecosystems, strengthening urban and rural environmental \\nmanagement , and preserving biological diversity as the basis for the ecological sustainability \\nof development and the reduction of the vulnerability of communities to disasters and global \\nchanges, while improving  adaptation and mitigation to the effects of climate change.  \\n16.

The barriers  generate persistent poverty that intensifies inequality, exclusion \\nand citizen insecurity. With the Ministry of People's Power for Planning (MPPP) and the \\ninstitutional and sectoral bodies that make up the national statistical and ge ographic system, \\nUNDP will strengthen the design, monitoring and evaluation of policies and progress toward \\nthe Goals. It will also strengthen national institutions responsible for implementing  poverty \\nreduction, social protection and inclusion policies to  help them improve inter -institutional \\ncoordination mechanisms and increase the effectiveness and coverage of these policies while \\npromoting the closing of the digital divide.
